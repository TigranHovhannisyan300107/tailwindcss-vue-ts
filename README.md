# Tailwind-vue test project

I separated all configuration files to easily identify where issues may arise in larger projects where there are multiple config files for a single type of configuration. To make the layout more manageable, I broke it down into smaller, reusable components. I organized my codebase by grouping actors into specific folders, such as a separate folder for the store, routes, views, and components. Additionally, before writing any logical functions, I wrote tests using the TDD approach. This allowed me to write more efficient and straightforward code.
